# FedNet: Federated Implementation of CNN for Facial Expression Recognition
This Project was carried out using TensorFlow 2.7.0, Scikit-Learn 1.0.2, opencv-python 4.5.5.
The 5 ipynb files contain 5 different implementation of FedNet on Extended CK+ dataset and FER-2013 dataset. The .py file contains useful functions. The CK+ small dataset is a cropped subset of the original dataset.
